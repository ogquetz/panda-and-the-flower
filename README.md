# An old friend
I made this SVG animation by hand in Notepad around 2005. I made it for my kids. I sat them on my knees and read it to them.

Over the years, I changed computers and ISPs, and I thought that the SVG code had been lost.

I found it today, in a folder that I had forgotten about. It is a single, massive file of 2,000 lines of hand-written XML from over a decade ago. It was broken. At the time, the only software supporting SVG animation was an Adobe plugin. But browser support has grown. As have my kids.

Finding Panda today felt like finding an old, worn toy. I spent the day rewiring some of the animations in Atom, feeling like I was sewing up some torn fabric of a well-loved teddy bear. I gave Panda a new home on GitHub, so she will not be lost again.

I hope you enjoy the story.
